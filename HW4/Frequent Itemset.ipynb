What will happen to bike load in most of time when the temperature and the precipitation both go up?\n",

    "From the sequence frequency result of set of 3 itemset. we see that the most frequently occurred sequence is (1, 0, -1), which have a frequency of 28. That meas when the temperature goes up, and the precipitation doesn't change the bike load goes down. One thing to notice is that it's hard for the temperature growth indicator value to be 0, since little change in temperature will still indicate a increase or decrease in temperature. This is the same for days when we actually have precipitation. So I believe that most of the instances when the precipitation growth indicator value is 0, that means the precipitaion is 0 or this pair of consecutive days. So fact high frequency of (1, 0, -1) means actually means that when the temperature goes up and there's no precipitation, the bike load would most likely to go down. And the second frequently occured sequence is (1, 0, 1), which means that when the temperature increase and there's no precipitation, bike load would most likely to go down. And these two completely different findings only has 5 count different. By looking at the data again, I found that I ignored one important factor, date. The bike count data was collected from April to October. So it make sense that during cold seasone, people prefer to take a bike when it's relatively warmer, and during hot season, people would prefer to take a bike when the weather is relatively cooler. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other 2 frequent sequence, (-1, -1, 1) is counted 22, and (1, 1, -1) is counted 23. These two tells the same about the relation ship between the precipitation and bike load. Bike load decreases when precipitation goes up, and increases when precipitation goes down. And as we can see from the frequent sequences that we barely see positive precipitation paired with negative temperature in any of the 4 common set-of-3 sequences. That indecates that, in new york, it rains more often during cold seasons. "
