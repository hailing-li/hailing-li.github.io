# The key toward the professional coding practice
When I was a kid, I started playing badminton. I pay it with my families, friends and classmates. And I play it everywhere I can, including playgrounds, corridors, and even living room. I love badminton, and I’ve been playing for years since I was little. You will probably assume, that I must be good at playing badminton. And you are right, I am. Well, it also depends on what “good” means to you. Even though I grow up playing badminton, I can’t be a professional badminton player, since I never know the rules. All I care when playing badminton was to catch the ball, then bit it back, in the manner which make it be easily caught by the other player, so that we can keep playing without stops. This is exactly why I can’t be professional, I never play with purpose of scoring and failing my opponent. This analogy applies to coding. We can’t be a professional order or software developer, if we don’t train ourselves with the rules or purpose predetermined in this profession. In many cases, software engineers are writing code that is part of a program, while the Whether to follow strict coding standard make a distinction between a professional coder and a non-professional coder.
