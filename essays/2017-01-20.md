First Impression on Free Code Camp 

I'm a completely newbie to JavaScript. I used online Free Code Camp to study JavaScript. I think this is useful to give you basic knowledge about JavaScript, but I don't really like it, since it only focus on teaching you the syntax of the language. And it didn’t tell you much about what this language can do. I would prefer learning by making small interesting programs. I found this make the syntax learning a bit more challenging, but for me it's a lot of fun.  

First Impression on JavaScript 

Before learning this language, I had experience to other programming languages, like, C, C++, Java. I think JavaScript is a lot easier than C, C++, and Java. In general, I think JavaScript is a better language in 3 ways. JavaScript is a lot easier to be executed, comparing to C, C++ and Java. C, C++ and Java need to be compiled before executed, but we can execute java directly without compilation. One main advantage of this is that we can run it online. I think this a big advantage for a new programmer, since they don't have to worry about laptop environment, which could be painful to setup for many people who has just started programing. Another thing that I notice is that in JavaScript, we don't have as much different datatype names as in C or Java languages. When using C or Java, we always has to make sure that we are assigning the right thing to the right type, otherwise it wouldn't compile successfully. In JavaScript we don't have Int, String or Char those kind of things, we can simply assign to certain type of value to the variable, and the it will automatically match. The third advantage of JavaScript is that, there's no pointers comparing to C or C++. When coding in C or C++, we are always required to make trace tables to make sure that the pointers are pointing to write thing, because if we do it wrong, we could mess up the whole program. So I think no pointers make JavaScript a lot easier to program comparing to C or C++. I think JavaScript is a good programming language for software engineers in General, because it's easy to use, it's good for web-app development, and it has awesome libraries,  such as, jQuery.

First Software Engineering Class

My first software engineering class adapts the concept of athletic software engineering. In this class we were required to do workout of the day (WOD). WODs are intense and short-duration exercises required in the beginning of the class. Basically, once a week, before we start the class, we need to solve a problem within limited time, we are not allowed to keep going when reaching the maximum time. And after that, the professor will give us answer. I personally love this idea of software engineering study. These kind of exercise give us the momentum to think quick. And it just give us a time to give-up so that we don't need to spend unnecessarily big amount time to solve a problem. I think this s great brain exercises that can eventually help us to think faster and faster. And I like this style of learning.
