Before knowing about software engineering ethics, I always a career in software engineering is ethically simple, since we are not like a doctor that could potential miss saving a life; we are not like a financial analysis who could potentially cause someone to go bankrupt, neither are we like structural engineers who might designing bridges that collapse accidentally. I used to think that software engineering is a “cleanest” and “safest” job, since most of the time, we only need to work with a computer.  After spending some time, studying the ethics of software engineering, I started to realize that, this is not an easy job, instead a software engineer position takes as much, if not more responsibility to the welfare of the community as those careers I talked about earlier because we are always taking a prominent position in all different fields, in which a lot of ethical concerns could be involved. 

 The article, [The code I’m still ashamed of]( https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e), has really made me to think deeply about how little programs we make can indirectly kill a life, without out violating government restrictions.  In many times, when we work as a software engineer, we would have someone above us, whose commands must be followed. And we are used to be told to do what “they” want, not what we want as well. In Bill’s case, I understand that it was on a really hard situation, but I still believe whoever in this situation should take the obligation to reject being used as a tool to hurt others. I am not here to judge that Bill decided to do. What I’m saying is that taking an obligation of the well-being of the others, and having a more comprehensive thinking on the impact of the programs produced, as described in imperatives 1.1, 1.2, and 2.5 of the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct]( http://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct), is what a professional computer worker should learn to do. 
 
On the other hand, it also worth to mention that an ethical problem always requires the whole community to solve. In many cases, individuals have little to do to stop the danger resulted by an ethical issue. For example, in Bill’s case, even if Bill could foresee the seriousness of his product, and inform the client again of the potential harm could be resulted by quiz produced. It’s not likely that his client will listen to him, since they should’ve already known better than Bill the risks of tricking young girls into buying the medicine with the side effect of depression. In that case, all Bill could do, was to reject the job, but that wouldn’t stop the tragedy from happening either, since there would always be someone, who was desperate to take the job. By rejecting the job, the only thing that will be different is that the software engineer wouldn’t have to bear the regret over time.

In conclusion, I believe that as a computer worker, we do have the ethical obligation toward the well-being of the community. Every computer profession should take ethical issues seriously, and try to study from others experiences to better deal with those ethical situations. However, almost no ethical issues could be completely resolved if no law was reinforced.
