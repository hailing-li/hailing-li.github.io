Contact Book is the first WebApp I made. It was made for my ICS314 class. This application was built with Semantic UI and Meteor. And It allows users to add, edit and delete contacts. 

Since this is an assignment for my undergraduate course. It was done under the direction of my professor Phillip Johnson. And it was developed based upon 2 meteor projects he built for this class, [Meteor Example Form]( https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-example-form/), and [Meteor Example Template]( http://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template/), and the full direction could be found online under experience learning section called [Digit 1~6]( http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s17/modules/meteor-2/).

This WebApp get me started with Meteor. I used to learn by watching videos before. In this project has taught me another learning style, learning with official documentations. To learn how to create webapp with Meteor, I studied the two base projects mentioned earlier. They has taught me how to keep the project structure and formatted so that it can be easily understood by others. 

The code is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/hailing-li/digits).
