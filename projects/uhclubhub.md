UH Manoa Club Hub is a Meteor Application Organizing Clubs for University of Hawaii at Manoa. When you come to the site, youâ€™ll come to a landing page. From there you can login with your University of Hawaii student account, then you will be authorized to see your homepage, in which the clubs you joint in should be displayed. By clicking on create club menu item, you can create a club by filling out a form. Then the club you created will be shown on browse club page. From there, other users can login and join a club, so that they can have your club and the events you created displayed in their hompage.   

Our group has 3 people. Besides me, [Christian]( https://github.com/christianleandro) and [Jameyia]( https://github.com/jameyia) are my other two group members. In this project, I was responsible with landing page. And brose club page. I used collection and schema to set up the database, which allow users to create and edit clubs with forms. And show the information on Brose club page. I also implemented the filter with interest feature, in which users can easily find clubs based on their interests.

By doing this project, I improved my project management skill. Since my other two members was busy with their work during the progress, I was an organizer of this project. I organized meetings, and send messages when deadlines of each stage of the development was coming.  This is such an important experience for me, since I always believe that communication is so important in team projects.

Please go the the [Project Home Page](https://uhclubhub.github.io/)for more detail about the project, and the code is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/uhclubhub/uhclubhub).
